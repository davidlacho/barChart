Goal
This project will consist of building a library that will allow other developers to generate bar charts on their web pages using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. You'll also be using jQuery to access and manipulate the DOM in order to draw the charts.

There are intentionally no visuals provided with this project, and many aspects of the UI are left intentionally vague. We are leaving you freedom to get creative with the UI. We encourage you to make the charts look presentable and even add extra flare with things like CSS transitions and animations.
